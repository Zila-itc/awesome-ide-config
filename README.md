# Project Awesome Configuration

## IDE Configuration

To enhance your development experience with Project Awesome, we recommend configuring your IDE with the following settings:

1. **Code Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting. Set up auto-format on save to maintain code quality.
2. **Extensions**: Install extensions for TypeScript, ESLint, and any framework-specific tools you might be using (e.g., React, Angular, Vue).
3. **Linting**: Enable ESLint to catch errors and enforce coding standards.
4. **Version Control**: Integrate with Git to manage code versions efficiently.
5. **Debugging**: Configure breakpoints and log points for effective debugging.

## AI Agent Configuration

Project Awesome integrates with an AI agent to enhance productivity and provide intelligent suggestions. Configure the AI agent with these settings:

1. **Access Tokens**: Securely store access tokens for the AI agent service in your environment variables.
2. **Agent Behavior**: Configure the agent to provide code suggestions, refactoring tips, and documentation generation.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure data privacy settings are enabled to protect sensitive information.
4. **Training Data**: Periodically update the training data to improve the agent's accuracy and relevance.

With these configurations, Project Awesome aims to provide a seamless and productive development environment. Be sure to customize settings based on your specific project requirements and personal preferences.
